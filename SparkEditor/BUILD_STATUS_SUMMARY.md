# ?? Spark Engine Editor - Build Status Summary

## ? **SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED ISSUES**

### 1. **Major Namespace Pollution Fix**
- **Issue**: `SparkEditor::std::ranges` namespace conflicts in system headers
- **Solution**: Removed problematic `<algorithm>` includes and namespace pollution sources
- **Result**: Clean namespace separation between SparkEditor and std

### 2. **Struct Redefinition Fixes**
- **Issue**: Duplicate definitions of TabFeatures, CustomZoneConfig, LayoutTemplate, Workspace
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate private struct definitions in SparkDockingSystem.h
- **Result**: Clean struct definitions without redefinition errors

### 3. **Destructor Duplication Fix**
- **Issue**: EditorLogger destructor defined both as `= default` in header and with body in .cpp
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate implementation, kept header declaration
- **Result**: Single, clean destructor definition

### 4. **Include Structure Optimization**
- **Issue**: Circular dependencies and missing includes causing undefined types
- **Solution**: Proper forward declarations and strategic include placement
- **Result**: Clean compile without circular dependency issues

### 5. **DockPosition Enum Consolidation**
- **Issue**: DockPosition defined in both EditorLayoutManager.h and SparkDockingSystem.h
- **Solution**: Single definition in EditorLayoutManager.h with proper includes
- **Result**: Unified enum usage across the system

## ??? **CURRENT WORKING FOUNDATION**
