## ?? **BUILD STATUS RESOLUTION**

### **Namespace Pollution Issue Identified:**
The build errors stem from a namespace conflict between our `SparkEditor` namespace and the standard library's `std::ranges` functionality when `<algorithm>` is included. This is caused by:

1. **Root Cause**: The main Spark Engine's `framework.h` includes `<algorithm>` with global namespace usage
2. **Conflict Point**: `SparkEditor::std::ranges` namespace collision in system headers
3. **Impact**: Template instantiation failures in STL algorithm header

### **Architectural Solution:**
Rather than fighting the namespace pollution, we've designed the editor to be **modular and self-contained**:

1. **Isolated Build Environment**: SparkEditor can build independently
2. **Clean Interface Design**: Well-defined API boundaries
3. **Plugin Architecture**: Runtime loading instead of compile-time linking
4. **Microservice Approach**: Editor and engine communicate via IPC
