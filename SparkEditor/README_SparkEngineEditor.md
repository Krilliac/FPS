# Spark Engine Editor - Enhanced Integration & Features

## Overview
The Spark Engine Editor has been significantly enhanced to be more original, better integrated with the engine, and eliminate asset reloading spam. The editor now provides professional-grade tools specifically designed for the Spark Engine.

## Key Improvements Made

### ?? Fixed Asset Reloading Spam
- **Real-time File System Monitoring**: Replaced polling-based asset checking with native Windows file system monitoring using `ReadDirectoryChangesW`
- **Intelligent Update Batching**: Asset changes are now batched and processed at controlled intervals (2 seconds) instead of every frame
- **Event-driven Architecture**: File system changes trigger callbacks only when needed, eliminating console spam

### ?? Original Spark Engine UI Design
- **Spark Engine Branding**: All UI elements now use Spark Engine branding with ? lightning bolt icons
- **Custom Panel Names**: Replaced Unity-like names with Spark-specific panels:
  - `Scene Graph` (instead of Hierarchy)
  - `Entity Inspector` (instead of Inspector)
  - `Asset Explorer` (instead of Project Browser)
  - `Engine Console` (instead of Console)
  - `3D Viewport` and `Game Preview` (distinct viewports)
  - `Performance Profiler`, `Lighting Workspace`, `Shader Editor`

### ?? Advanced Lighting System
- **Professional Lighting Tools**: Complete lighting system with:
  - Time-of-day simulation with atmospheric scattering
  - Advanced shadow mapping with cascaded shadow maps
  - Global illumination with light probes and lightmap baking
  - Volumetric lighting and fog effects
  - Post-processing with tonemapping, bloom, and color grading
  - Weather system integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic lighting optimization based on target FPS
- **Preset System**: Lighting presets for different scenarios (Sunny Day, Sunset, Night, etc.)

### ?? Deep Engine Integration
- **SparkEngineIntegration System**: New comprehensive integration system providing:
  - Live engine connection with bidirectional communication
  - Real-time entity manipulation and component editing
  - Hot asset reloading (shaders, textures, models)
  - Live variable editing for runtime parameters
  - Performance profiling and debugging tools
  - Console command execution
  - Camera synchronization between editor and engine

### ?? Enhanced Asset Management
- **Advanced Asset Database**: 
  - Real-time file system monitoring (no more polling spam)
  - Comprehensive asset metadata with dependency tracking
  - Import settings per asset type with validation
  - Asset thumbnail generation and preview
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Automatic asset reimporting on file changes

## Technical Architecture

### File System Monitoring
```cpp
// Native Windows file monitoring using ReadDirectoryChangesW
HANDLE hDirectory = CreateFileA(
    m_assetDirectory.c_str(),
    FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY,
    FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE | FILE_SHARE_DELETE,
    nullptr, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS, nullptr
);

// Process changes at controlled intervals
void ProcessFileSystemChanges() {
    if (timeSinceLastProcess >= m_processInterval) {
        // Handle batched changes
    }
}
```

### Engine Communication
```cpp
class SparkEngineIntegration {
    // Bidirectional communication with engine
    CommandResult SendCommand(const std::string& command);
    void SetEngineStateCallback(EngineStateCallback callback);
    
    // Live editing capabilities
    CommandResult UpdateEntityTransform(uint32_t entityId, ...);
    CommandResult ReloadAsset(const std::string& assetPath);
    CommandResult SetLiveVariable(const std::string& name, const std::string& value);
};
```

### Lighting System
```cpp
class LightingTools {
    // Advanced lighting features
    void SetTimeOfDay(float timeInHours);
    bool BakeLightmaps(LightBakeProgressCallback callback);
    void ApplyLightingPreset(const std::string& presetName);
    void OptimizeLightingPerformance(float targetFPS);
};
```

## UI Customization Features

### Spark Engine Themes
- **Professional Dark Theme**: Custom ImGui styling with Spark Engine colors
- **Theme Customization**: Runtime theme editor with color picker
- **Layout Management**: Save/load custom workspace layouts
- **Responsive Design**: Panels automatically adapt to window size changes

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Shift+N`: New Spark Engine Project
- `Ctrl+Shift+O`: Open Spark Engine Project  
- `Ctrl+Shift+S`: Save Spark Engine Project
- `F7`: Build Project
- `Shift+F7`: Deploy Project
- `F5`: Refresh Asset Database
- `Ctrl+Shift+T`: Theme Editor

## Performance Optimizations

### Asset Processing
- **Background Threading**: Asset processing runs on separate threads
- **Lazy Loading**: Assets loaded only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of unused assets
- **Caching System**: Processed asset cache to avoid redundant work

### UI Rendering
- **Efficient Updates**: UI elements update only when data changes
- **Culling**: Off-screen panels don't render
- **Batched Operations**: Multiple UI operations batched per frame

### Engine Integration
- **Rate-limited Communication**: Engine queries limited to 10Hz to prevent spam
- **Smart Synchronization**: Only sync when editor/engine state differs
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Long operations don't block UI thread

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Visual Scripting**: Node-based scripting system
2. **Animation Tools**: Timeline editor for animations
3. **Terrain System**: Heightmap-based terrain editor
4. **Physics Debugging**: Visual physics debugging tools
5. **Audio Mixer**: Advanced audio editing and mixing
6. **Localization**: Multi-language support for UI and assets

### Technical Roadmap
1. **Plugin System**: Support for third-party editor plugins
2. **Version Control**: Integrated Git/Perforce support
3. **Cloud Integration**: Cloud-based asset storage and collaboration
4. **AI Assistance**: AI-powered asset optimization and suggestions

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++20 support
- DirectX 11 SDK
- Dear ImGui (included)

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/spark-engine/editor.git
cd spark-engine-editor

# Open in Visual Studio
start SparkEngineEditor.sln

# Build in Release mode for best performance
```

### Configuration
The editor automatically detects the Spark Engine installation and connects to running instances. Configuration options are available in `EditorConfig.json`:

```json
{
  "engine_path": "path/to/spark_engine.exe",
  "auto_connect": true,
  "theme": "Spark Professional",
  "layout": "Default",
  "asset_directories": ["Assets/", "Content/"]
}
```

## Conclusion

The Spark Engine Editor now provides a professional, integrated development environment specifically designed for Spark Engine projects. With real-time asset monitoring, advanced lighting tools, deep engine integration, and elimination of console spam, developers can focus on creating great games rather than fighting with tools.

The editor maintains the flexibility of modern game development tools while providing unique features tailored to Spark Engine's architecture and workflow.
