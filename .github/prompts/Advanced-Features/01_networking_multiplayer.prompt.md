# Networking and Multiplayer Systems
Network architecture for multiplayer games and engine communication.

## Network Features
1. **Client-Server Architecture**
   - Authoritative server design patterns
   - Client prediction and rollback systems
   - Lag compensation techniques
   - Network optimization and bandwidth management
   - Anti-cheat integration and validation

2. **Communication Systems**
   - Reliable and unreliable messaging protocols
   - State synchronization across clients
   - Event-driven networking architecture
   - Network debugging and diagnostic tools
   - Real-time multiplayer coordination

## Engine Communication
- **Named Pipe Communication**: SparkEngine ? SparkConsole
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Editor-engine integration
- **Network Console**: Remote debugging and administration
- **Real-time Parameter Sync**: Live tuning across network
- **Distributed Development**: Team collaboration tools

## Multiplayer Systems
- Player connection management and authentication
- World state replication and synchronization
- Input handling and validation across network
- Lobby and matchmaking systems
- Session management and persistence

## Network Optimization
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Compression and delta encoding
- **Latency Reduction**: Prediction and interpolation
- **Connection Quality**: Adaptive quality based on network
- **Load Balancing**: Server distribution and scaling
- **Fault Tolerance**: Reconnection and recovery systems

## Console Commands
- `net_connect <address>` - Connect to game server
- `net_host <port>` - Host multiplayer session
- `net_debug` - Network diagnostics and statistics
- `net_simulate_lag <ms>` - Simulate network conditions
- `player_list` - Show connected players
- `net_bandwidth` - Display bandwidth usage

## Development Features
- Network simulation for testing
- Automated network testing scenarios
- Performance profiling for networked systems
- Real-time network visualization
- Integration with engine console system

## Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Anti-cheat system integration
- Secure authentication protocols
- DDoS protection and rate limiting
- Encrypted communication channels

## Integration Points
- Console command networking for remote debugging
- Asset synchronization across development team
- Build system coordination for team development
- Version control integration for collaborative development
- Real-time collaboration features in editor

*Note: Networking is currently disabled in build to avoid CURL dependencies, but architecture is designed for future implementation.*
