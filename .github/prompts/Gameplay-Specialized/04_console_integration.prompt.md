   - 200+ registered commands across all engine systems
   - Command auto-completion and intelligent help system
   - Command history with search and favorites
   - Parameter validation and type checking
   - Hierarchical command organization

2. **External Console Application**
   - **SparkConsole.exe**: Separate console application
   - Named pipe communication with SparkEngine
   - Real-time parameter adjustment during gameplay
   - Concurrent engine and console operation
   - Professional command-line interface

## Console Integration
