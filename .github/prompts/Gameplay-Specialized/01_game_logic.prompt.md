# Game Logic and Gameplay Systems
Complete game mechanics and player systems.

## Player Systems
1. **Player Controller**
   - First-person movement and controls
   - Physics-based character controller
   - Input handling and responsiveness
   - Animation system integration
   - Smooth camera movement

2. **Camera System**
   - SparkEngineCamera with smooth controls
   - Multiple camera modes (FPS, third-person, debug)
   - Camera shake and procedural effects
   - Console-controlled camera debugging
   - Real-time parameter adjustment

## Game Objects
- GameObject base class with Transform component
- Primitive objects (CubeObject, SphereObject, PlaneObject, etc.)
- Model loading and rendering integration
- Physics collision integration
- Component-based architecture

## Scene Management
- SceneManager for object lifecycle
- Transform hierarchy and parenting
- Object pooling for performance
- Serialization and deserialization
- Runtime object creation/destruction

## Console Commands
- `player_speed <value>` - Adjust movement speed
- `noclip <on/off>` - Toggle collision
- `god_mode <on/off>` - Invincibility mode
- `teleport <x> <y> <z>` - Player teleportation
- `camera_mode <fps/third/debug>` - Camera mode switching
- `spawn_object <type>` - Runtime object spawning

## Game State Management
- Pause/resume functionality
- Time scale control for debugging
- Game mode switching
- Level loading and transitions
- Save/load system integration

## Development Features
- Real-time parameter tuning via console
- Debug visualization for game objects
- Performance monitoring and profiling
- Hot-reloading of game logic
- Integration with SparkEditor

## Performance Considerations
- Object pooling for frequently created objects
- Efficient update loops
- Spatial partitioning for large scenes
- LOD system for distant objects
- Memory-efficient component storage
