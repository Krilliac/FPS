# Graphics and Rendering Pipeline Tasks
Advanced DirectX 11 rendering with modern techniques and comprehensive console integration.

## Core Graphics Features
1. **DirectX 11 Rendering Pipeline**
   - Robust device creation with proper error handling
   - Device lost/reset handling with resource recreation
   - Multi-adapter support and selection
   - Debug layer integration for development builds
   - GraphicsEngine with professional architecture

2. **Advanced Rendering**
   - Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
   - Deferred/Forward+ rendering pipeline
   - Shadow mapping and advanced lighting
   - Post-processing effects pipeline
   - HDR rendering and tone mapping

## Resource Management
1. **Efficient Asset Pipeline**
   - Model loading (OBJ support via TinyObjLoader)
   - Texture streaming and compression
   - Shader hot-reloading and compilation
   - Mesh optimization and LOD generation
   - Material system with PBR properties

2. **Memory Optimization**
   - Buffer pooling and reuse strategies
   - Memory usage tracking and optimization
   - Garbage collection for unused resources
   - VRAM usage monitoring and reporting

## Shader System
1. **HLSL Pipeline Management**
   - Shader compilation and caching
   - Hot-reloading for development workflow
   - Error reporting and debugging tools
   - Constant buffer optimization
   - Multi-threaded rendering commands

2. **Post-Processing Pipeline**
   - HDR rendering with tone mapping
   - Anti-aliasing (MSAA, FXAA, TAA)
   - Screen-space effects (SSAO, bloom, fog)
   - Gamma correction and color grading

## Performance Optimization
- Frustum and occlusion culling
- Instanced rendering and batching
- GPU-driven rendering techniques
- Command buffer optimization
- Memory-efficient resource management
- Draw call batching and optimization

## Console Integration
### Graphics Control Commands
- `graphics_vsync <true/false>` - Toggle vertical synchronization
- `graphics_wireframe <true/false>` - Toggle wireframe rendering
- `graphics_clearcolor <r> <g> <b> <a>` - Set background color
- `render_debug` - Toggle wireframe, normals, bounds
- `shader_reload <name>` - Hot-reload specific shaders
- `graphics_stats` - Real-time rendering statistics

### Performance & Debugging
- `graphics_screenshot <filename>` - Capture frame to file
- `graphics_device_reset` - Reset graphics device
- `graphics_memory_usage` - Display VRAM usage
- `graphics_performance_stats` - Show detailed metrics
- `vsync <on/off>` - V-sync control
- `wireframe <on/off>` - Wireframe rendering mode
- `culling_debug` - Visualize culling operations

## Quality Requirements
- Maintain 60+ FPS with editor active
- Handle all error conditions gracefully
- Support window resize and fullscreen transitions
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Zero memory leaks in graphics subsystem

## Implementation Guidelines
