# Core Engine Development Tasks
Professional game engine core systems and architecture.

## Engine Systems
1. **Core Framework**
   - SparkEngine main loop optimization
   - Thread-safe operations throughout
   - Performance monitoring and profiling
   - Memory management and object pooling
   - Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture

2. **Component System Integration**
   - Component reflection and serialization
   - Runtime component modification
   - Performance-optimized entity queries
   - Transform hierarchy management
   - Object lifecycle management

## Engine Integration
- Real-time engine parameter control via console
- Live debugging and inspection tools
- Hot-reloading of game logic and assets
- Multi-threading coordination
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Console Commands
- `engine_status` - Core engine health monitoring
- `memory_info` - Memory usage and leak detection
- `thread_status` - Thread pool and synchronization status
- `performance_profile` - Real-time performance metrics
- `entity_count` - Active entity statistics
- `component_list` - Available component types

## Development Guidelines
- Follow modern C++20 standards
- Maintain thread-safety across all systems
- Use ASSERT macros for validation
- Integrate with external console for debugging
- Document all public APIs thoroughly
