# Build and Deployment System
Professional CI/CD pipeline for game development.

## Build System
1. **Multi-Platform Builds**
   - **Windows**: x86, x64 architectures
   - **Linux**: x64 with cross-compilation
   - **macOS**: Intel and Apple Silicon support
   - **Mobile**: Android ARM32/ARM64, iOS ARM64
   - **Console**: Xbox, PlayStation platforms
   - **Web**: WebGL/WebAssembly builds

2. **Build Automation**
   - CMake configuration management
   - Parallel compilation optimization
   - Asset cooking and compression
   - Package generation and code signing
   - Automated testing integration

## BuildDeploymentSystem Features
- **Build Targets**: Configurable platform builds
- **Build Queue**: Parallel and sequential build management
- **Asset Cooking**: Platform-specific asset optimization
- **Deployment**: Automated distribution to multiple channels
- **Build Statistics**: Performance monitoring and reporting

## Deployment Channels
- Steam integration with Steamworks SDK
- Epic Games Store deployment
- Mobile app store distribution (iOS App Store, Google Play)
- Custom distribution channels
- Internal testing and QA deployment

## Console Commands
