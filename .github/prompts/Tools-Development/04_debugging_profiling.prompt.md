# Debugging and Profiling Tools
Advanced development and optimization tools.

## Debugging Features
1. **Crash Handler System**
   - Automatic crash dump generation with full memory dumps
   - Stack trace analysis with symbol resolution
   - CrashHandler and CrashHandlerHelpers integration
   - Upload system for crash reports to development team
   - Integration with external console for crash logging

2. **Assert System**
   - Custom assertion macros (ASSERT, ASSERT_MSG, ASSERT_ALWAYS_MSG)
   - Conditional assert behavior (crash vs. log mode)
   - Assert crash mode toggling via console
   - External console logging for assertion failures
   - Thread-safe assertion handling

## Performance Profiling
- Real-time performance metrics display
- Frame timing analysis and bottleneck identification
- Memory usage tracking and leak detection
- GPU performance monitoring
- Thread utilization analysis

## Debugging Tools
- **Console Integration**: 200+ commands for real-time debugging
- **Memory Snapshots**: Capture and analyze memory state
- **Performance Counters**: CPU, GPU, memory metrics
