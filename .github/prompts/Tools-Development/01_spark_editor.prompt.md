## Console Integration
### Window Management
- `editor_window <name> <true/false>` - Toggle window visibility
- `editor_theme <Dark/Light/Classic>` - Change theme
- `editor_layout_save <filename>` - Save current layout
- `editor_layout_load <filename>` - Load saved layout
- `editor_reset_layout` - Reset to default layout

### Editor Control
- `panel_toggle <name>` - Show/hide specific panels
- `asset_refresh` - Refresh asset database
- `layout_save <name>` - Save current layout configuration
- `viewport_focus` - Focus on viewport panel
- `inspector_lock <on/off>` - Lock inspector to selection

### Development Features

## Performance Considerations
- Ensure no blocking operations on UI thread
- Implement async operations for heavy tasks
- Use efficient rendering for large hierarchies
- Monitor and optimize frame time impact
- Lazy loading of asset previews
- Background asset processing
- Memory-efficient editor operations
- Responsive UI with large projects

## Development Features
- Hot-reloading of editor UI elements
- Real-time engine parameter adjustment
- Live asset preview and editing
- Multi-monitor support and DPI awareness
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Professional visual feedback systems

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use ImGui best practices for responsive UI
- Implement proper state persistence across sessions
- Add comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
- Ensure accessibility and usability standards
- Test with various window sizes and DPI settings
- Follow modern C++20 practices
- Maintain thread-safety in editor operations

## Integration Points
