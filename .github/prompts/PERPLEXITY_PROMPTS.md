# Perplexity AI Research Prompts for SparkEngine

## Graphics Research
"Research latest DirectX 11 best practices for device lost handling in 2025. 
Include code examples for robust resource recreation and integration patterns 
for game engines with ImGui editors."

"Compare PBR (Physically Based Rendering) implementation approaches for 
DirectX 11. Focus on Cook-Torrance BRDF vs simplified models, performance 
implications, and shader optimization techniques."

## Audio Research
"Investigate XAudio2 3D audio optimization techniques for game engines. 
Include spatial audio algorithms, performance considerations, and integration 
with procedural sound generation."

## Performance Research
"Analyze modern C++ memory pooling strategies for game engines. Compare 
object pooling implementations, cache-friendly data structures, and 
multi-threaded memory management patterns."

## UI/Editor Research
"Research ImGui advanced docking and layout management. Include persistent 
layout serialization, custom widget development, and performance optimization 
for complex editor interfaces."

## General Development
"Compare cross-platform game engine architecture patterns. Focus on modular 
design, plugin systems, and console integration for debugging and development."
