/**
 * @brief High-precision timer for game engine timing
 * 
 * The Timer class provides accurate timing functionality for game engines using
 * the system's high-resolution clock. It tracks delta time between frames and
 * total elapsed time, supporting pause/resume functionality for game state management.
 * 
 * Features include:
 * - High-precision timing using std::chrono::high_resolution_clock
 * - Delta time calculation for frame-rate independent updates
 * - Total elapsed time tracking
 * - Pause/resume functionality
 * - Automatic time tracking with simple interface
 * 
 * @note Delta time is calculated between consecutive calls to GetDeltaTime()
 * @warning Ensure Start() is called before using timing functions
